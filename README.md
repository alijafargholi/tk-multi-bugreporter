This app originally was created by 
[Shotgun Software](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com/), I believe by 
[Jeff Beeland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jefferybeeland/), and was 
demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT2WlQaJVmY). I
modified it a bit to accommodate my need in our studio.
